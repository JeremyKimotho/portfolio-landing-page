      <p>
          Hello! Welcome to my page, I'm Jeremy. I'm an 18 year old from Nairobi, Kenya who's just began taking a class on programming. I decided to do this because I wanted to take a gap year and have a break from "formal learning" before I made my way to university.

          An interest in Computer Science and technology as a whole has always been a part of who I am and that's another reason I was keen to take a class on programming. My background is the British education system and I attended an International school graduating -having finished my A-Levels- in May 2018; where I did Chemistry, Biology, and Math. Before I began this course, I'd completed work experience at three companies- two of them being tech companies. The first was Cellulant in 2015 and then Fintech in 2017; both of these experiences at these firms only strengthened my interest in the industry and my drive to go on to do Computer Science.

          Other interests of mine are sports-related. Iâ€™m a big football fan and avid NBA supporter, my teams are Manchester United and the New Orleans Pelicans. I sometimes play golf and tennis and was once a competitive swimmer.
