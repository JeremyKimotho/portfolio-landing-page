## Description
{This is a webpage that contains my info and a few personal details. It has several links that all require someone to hover over them to be "seen", after which they then turn red. The image is floated to the right and has a specific top margin to make it flush with the "About Me" and also a specific right margin that pushes it further center andd gives the page more overall balance. It also uses a media query to cater for different sized devices.}
