## Description
{This is a webpage that contains my info and a few personal details. It has several links that all require someone to hover over them to be "seen", after which they then turn red. The image is floated to the right and has a specific top margin to make it flush with the "About Me" and also a specific right margin that pushes it further center andd gives the page more overall balance. It also uses a media query to cater for different sized devices.}
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Have a git initialised folder on your machine that will accept the pull
* Pull the code
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
